This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates various approaches to semantic segmentation using different deep learning models. The notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of instance segmentation techniques and their implementations.

## Sections

1. **Instance Segmentation**
   - An introduction to instance segmentation and its importance in computer vision.

2. **For Faster R-CNN**
   - Detailed implementation of the Faster R-CNN model for object detection and segmentation.

3. **For MobileNet**
   - Implementation of MobileNet for lightweight and efficient instance segmentation.

4. **For RetinaNet**
   - Application of RetinaNet for robust and accurate object detection.

5. **For Single Shot Detection**
   - Single Shot Detection (SSD) model implementation for real-time object detection and segmentation.

## Libraries Used

The notebook utilizes several powerful libraries for deep learning and image processing:

- `numpy`
- `torch`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `torchvision.transforms.functional`
- `torchvision.utils`
- `PIL`
